        the soft grass is growing
        the sweet breeze is blowing
        the air all full of singing feels just right
        so no excuses now
        we're going to the park
        to chase and charge and chew
        and I will make you see
        what spring is all about"

          warm fur,
          a perfect fire
          to lie beside,
          a cozy lap
          where I can nap,
          an empty chair
          when she's not there.
          I want heat
               on my feet
               on my nose
               on my hide.
          No cat I remember
          dislikes December
               inside."

  He picked up all my mail.
  He cleaned my dirty closet
  and dusted with his tail.

  He straightened out my posters
  and swept my wooden floor.
  My parents almost fainted
  when he fixed my bedroom door.

  I did not try to stop him.
  He made my windows shine.
  My room looked like a palace,
  and my dresser smelled like pine.

  He fluffed up every pillow.
  He folded all my clothes.
  He even cleaned my fish tank
  with a toothbrush and a hose.

  I thought it was amazing
  to see him use a broom.
  I’m glad he ate my essay
  on “How to Clean My Room.”"

  It simply is the best.
  Without an A, you could not get
  an A+ on a test.
  You’d never see an acrobat
  or eat an apple pie.
  You couldn’t be an astronaut
  or kiss your aunt goodbye.
  An antelope would not exist.
  An ape would be unknown.
  You’d never hear a person
  say “Afraid” or “All Alone”.
  The A’s in avocado
  would completely disappear
  and certain words would be forgot
  like “ankle”, “arm”, and “ear”.

  Without the A, you couldn’t aim
  an arrow in the air.
  You wouldn’t ask for apricots
  or almonds at a fair.
  Aruba and Australia
  would be missing from a map.
  You’d never use an ATM,
  an apron, or an app.
  The arctic fox and aardvark
  would be absent from the zoo,
  and vowels, as you know them,
  would be E, I, O, and U.
  There wouldn’t be an A chord
  on the instruments you play.
  Let’s appreciate, admire,
  and applaud the letter A!"
